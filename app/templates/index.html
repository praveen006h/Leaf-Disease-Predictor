       <h1>Abstract</h1>
       <p>
            Agricultural productivity is something on which economy highly depends. This is the one of the reasons that disease detection in plants plays an important role in agriculture field, as having disease in plants are quite natural. If proper care is not taken in this area then it causes serious effects on plants and due to which respective product quality, quantity or productivity is affected. For instance a disease named little leaf disease is a hazardous disease found in pine trees in United States. Detection of plant disease through some automatic technique is beneficial as it reduces a large work of monitoring in big farms of crops, and at very early stage itself it detects the symptoms of diseases i.e. when they appear on plant leaves. This paper presents an algorithm for image segmentation technique which is used for automatic detection and classification of plant leaf diseases. It also covers survey on different diseases classification techniques that can be used for plant leaf disease detection. Image segmentation, which is an important aspect for disease detection in plant leaf disease, is done by using genetic algorithm.

               <p>
                    To improve the accuracy and speed of leaf disease detection through the use of advanced imaging and machine learning techniques. By developing reliable and efficient methods for detecting and diagnosing diseases affecting crop leaves, we can help farmers protect their crops and improve food security.

                        Leaf disease detection applications can help protect crops from disease outbreaks, reducing the risk of crop loss and increasing yields.Early detection of leaf diseases can help farmers and researchers intervene before the disease spreads, saving time and resources.

      <h1>HOW IT WORKS?</h1>
      <p>Leaf disease detection applications often use a combination of imaging and machine learning techniques to analyze images of crop leaves and identify signs of disease. The process typically involves the following steps:

When a user uploads an image to a leaf disease detection application, the image is typically stored temporarily on the application's servers while the analysis is being performed. The user may be prompted to provide additional information about the crop or the location where the image was taken, which can help improve the accuracy of the analysis. Once the analysis is complete, the results are typically displayed to the user in a user-friendly interface that provides clear and actionable recommendations.
